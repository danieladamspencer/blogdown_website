title: About
---

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Statistics Department at Indiana University helping to develop Bayesian methods to analyze neuroimaging data under Dr. Amanda Mejia. I graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz in June 2020 with my dissertation *Inference and Uncertainty Quantification for High-Dimensional Tensor Regression with Tensor Decompositions and Bayesian Methods*. I am also a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer, having served in Mozambique from 2011-2013. I have lots of interests outside of statistics, including sustainability, running, cycling, and (recently) gardening.
