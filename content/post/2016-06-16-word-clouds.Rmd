Last summer, I was fortunate to be able to take a two-day short course with [Abel Rodriguez](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~abel/website/Home/Home.html) here at UCSC. He based the course on the quarter-long [Art of Data Visualization](https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/ams80b/Winter15/01) course that he had taught that winter quarter. It was super interesting, and it motivated me to try a few things on my own, including a word cloud. I use [Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice), which saves all of my text messages in spreadsheet format. I downloaded the information that I needed, and I set off. 

I decided to make one for the text messages with my wife, and another one for a friend of mine that also took the short course with me. They came out as follows:

```{r}
##### Word cloud fun
library(XML)
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

*Lisa's word cloud*

```{r}
Lisa <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Lisa.csv") #Note: Replace with your own .csv
Jo <- Lisa$message
Jo.corpus <- Corpus(DataframeSource(data.frame(as.character(Jo))))
Jo.corpus <- tm_map(Jo.corpus, removePunctuation)
Jo.corpus <- tm_map(Jo.corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
Jo.corpus <- tm_map(Jo.corpus, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
Jo.tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(Jo.corpus)
Jo.m <- as.matrix(Jo.tdm)
Jo.v <- sort(rowSums(Jo.m),decreasing=TRUE)
Jo.d <- data.frame(word = names(Jo.v),freq = Jo.v)
table(Jo.d$freq)
pal2 <- brewer.pal(8,"Dark2")
# windows(width = 12, height = 12)
wordcloud(Jo.d$word,Jo.d$freq,scale = c(8,.2),min.freq = 3,random.order = FALSE, rot.per = .15, colors = pal2)
```

There's a bit of a difference between the two, huh? The code for this example can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/danieladamspencer/Code/tree/master/Word%20Cloud).
