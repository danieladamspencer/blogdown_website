      <description>Consider a scenario in which noisy data are observed, with variance driven by two primary sources: signal and noise. We can write the data generation as
\[ W_{ij} = X_i + E_{ij}, \quad i = 1,\ldots, n, \quad j = 1,2 \]
Here, consider \(X_i\) as the signal and \(E_{ij}\) as the noise, with values generated from zero-mean normal distributions.
\[ X_i \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma_x^2), \quad E_{ij} \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma_e^2) \]</description>

      <description>The next few posts on this website will be based on emails that I have been sending to the Applied Mathematics and Statistics department every Monday as part of a reminder of the weekly doughnut social event that I help facilitate. In many of those emails, I include a data vizualization with very little explanation. Iâ€™ll include more here, like the motivation and the thought process, as well as the code and data source used to make the visualization.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Statistics Department at Indiana University helping to develop Bayesian methods to analyze neuroimaging data under Dr. Amanda Mejia. I graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz in June 2020 with my dissertation Inference and Uncertainty Quantification for High-Dimensional Tensor Regression with Tensor Decompositions and Bayesian Methods. I am also a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer, having served in Mozambique from 2011-2013. I have lots of interests outside of statistics, including sustainability, running, cycling, and (recently) gardening.</description>
