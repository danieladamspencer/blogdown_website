      <description>The next few posts on this website will be based on emails that I have been sending to the Applied Mathematics and Statistics department every Monday as part of a reminder of the weekly doughnut social event that I help facilitate. In many of those emails, I include a data vizualization with very little explanation. Iâ€™ll include more here, like the motivation and the thought process, as well as the code and data source used to make the visualization.</description>
