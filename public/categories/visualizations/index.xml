      <description>The next few posts on this website will be based on emails that I have been sending to the Applied Mathematics and Statistics department every Monday as part of a reminder of the weekly doughnut social event that I help facilitate. In many of those emails, I include a data vizualization with very little explanation. Iâ€™ll include more here, like the motivation and the thought process, as well as the code and data source used to make the visualization.</description>

      <description>Last summer, I was fortunate to be able to take a two-day short course with Abel Rodriguez here at UCSC. He based the course on the quarter-long Art of Data Visualization course that he had taught that winter quarter. It was super interesting, and it motivated me to try a few things on my own, including a word cloud. I use Google Voice, which saves all of my text messages in spreadsheet format.</description>
